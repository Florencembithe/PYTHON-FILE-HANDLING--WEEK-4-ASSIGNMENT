=====================================
PROCESS TEXT - PYTHON FILE HANDLING
=====================================

This is a simple Python script that:
- Reads a file called input.txt
- Converts all the text to uppercase
- Counts the total number of words
- Saves the processed content and word count to a file called output.txt
- Prints a success message in the terminal

---------------------
HOW TO USE THE SCRIPT
---------------------

1. Open your text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, etc.)

2. Create a file named: input.txt
   - Add at least 5 lines of text.
   - Example:

     Hello there!
     This is my first Python file.
     I love programming.
     Python makes file handling easy.
     Let's process this!

3. Save input.txt in the same folder as your Python file.

4. Now run the Python script (process_text.py) using the terminal or your code editor.

   Example (in terminal):
   python process_text.py

5. After running, check the same folder.
   Youâ€™ll find a new file: output.txt

   It will look like this:

   === PROCESSED TEXT ===
   HELLO THERE!
   THIS IS MY FIRST PYTHON FILE.
   ...

   === WORD COUNT ===
   Total words: 25

This is a great beginner project to practice file input/output in Python.
